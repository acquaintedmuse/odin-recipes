        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the first cookie I ever learned to make as a child. They're very delicious with the peanut butter and oatmeal. 
            You can eat them fresh out of the pan in a bowl with a spoon, which is delicious with a glass of milk besides. 
            This no-bake cookie recipe was my grandmother's, and my mother taught it to her children, and I will to mine. 
            I hope you have as much fun making this either by yourself or with your children, as I did with my mom. 
            Separate cookies with waxed paper if putting in a tin or baggie to prevent sticking.</p>
