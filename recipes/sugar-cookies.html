        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This simple butter cookies recipe can be used in a cookie press, made as a drop cookie, or shaped into a roll and sliced. 
            There is no special cookie recipe for a cookie press â€” any stiff butter type of cookie can be used! 
            Just be sure to chill it thoroughly so it keeps its shape while baking.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 2/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. 
                Beat in egg, then stir in the vanilla. 
                Combine flour and salt in a separate bowl; add to butter mixture and mix to form a dough. 
                Cover dough with plastic wrap and chill for at least one hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Chill two cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Transfer chilled dough to a cookie press; press out onto chilled cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden at the edges, about 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Transfer cookies to wire racks to cool.</li>
        </ol>
